## Hi there! 👋
I'm Joshua, a data scientist with a strong sense of curiosity and a self-motivated attitude towards programming, especially in data engineering, data science, and AI development. I began my programming journey by completing the Hacktiv8 bootcamp as a data scientist. I decided to leave my previous career in the hospitality and digital marketing industries. I'm passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. I'm a hard worker, humble, and easy-going person.
